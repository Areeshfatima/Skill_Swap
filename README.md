What is SkillSwap?

Skill SkillSwap is a platform where you can trade skills with others. Want to learn guitar but can’t afford lessons? No problem! Teach someone coding, and they will teach you guitar. It’s like a barter system for skills coding, cooking, graphic design, you name it. You sign up, list what you can teach and what you want to learn, and connect with others to swap. It’s free to use, but there’s a $5/month premium option for unlimited swaps and priority matching.

Why I Chose This Project

I choose SkillSwap because I have always loved learning new things, but classes and courses can be so expensive. Not everyone has the cash to pay for a photography course or a coding bootcamp. I thought, why not create a way for people to learn from each other? It’s a win-win: you share your skills, learn something new, and build a community. Plus, it’s perfect for students, freelancers, or anyone who wants to grow without breaking the bank. I wanted to make learning accessible and fun, and SkillSwap does just that.

What Problem Does It Solve?

In today’s world, learning new skills is super important, but it’s often out of reach for many people. Online courses can cost hundreds of dollars, and not everyone has the time or money for that. SkillSwap solves this by letting you trade skills directly with others. It’s affordable (free for basic use!), community-driven, and empowering. Whether you’re a student wanting to learn graphic design or a retiree teaching knitting, SkillSwap connects you with people who can help you grow. It’s like a big, friendly skill-sharing party!

How It Works

Tech Behind It

I built SkillSwap with:
